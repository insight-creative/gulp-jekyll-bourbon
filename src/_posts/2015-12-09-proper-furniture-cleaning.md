title: Proper Furniture Cleaning
---

Impending holiday entertaining causes many of us to take a good hard look around our home. That’s when you notice your furniture may not look as attractive as it once did. Never fear, Stanley is near …

You can count on Stanley Steemer for expert furniture cleaning in addition to carpets. Our trained technicians thoroughly clean upholstered furniture—often with the same highly effective hot-water extraction method we’ve effectively used on carpets for many years.

First we’ll examine your furniture to determine the correct cleaning method. Then we use our specially formulated furniture-cleaning agents to powerfully but safely clean your furniture. Our experts ensure that everything is done right—without damaging the fabric. You’ll be rid of the dirt, dust and other pollutants that collect in the cracks and crevices of upholstered and leather furniture and you can take comfort in knowing you’re extending the life of your valuable furniture. The results speak for themselves: cleaner furniture, longer wear and improved air quality.

We can also deodorize and protect your furniture after cleaning, just as we do with carpets. We spray a protector on your furniture to create an invisible barrier around the fibers. This improves resistance to dry soil, water-based stains, and daily wear and tear. We can also apply a deodorizer that neutralizes odors by eliminating them at their source.

Remember, even leather furniture needs regular cleaning. But unlike upholstered furniture, leather faces the added challenge of lost moisture and softness. Store-bought leather cleaners and conditioners provide immediate relief, but they can also cause long-term damage. Proper maintenance demands an experienced professional using safe cleaning agents, moisturizers and protectors to renew your leather furniture.

Don’t settle and don’t buy new furniture unnecessarily. Let the professionals from your locally owned Stanley Steemer inject new life into your favorite chair or sofa.
