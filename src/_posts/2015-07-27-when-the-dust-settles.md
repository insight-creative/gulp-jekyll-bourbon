Another busy summer is coming to a close. No doubt there’s been a hot frenzy of activity circulating in and out of your home over the last few months. From parties to play dates, the increased traffic of people and pets has certainly brought all sorts of summer fun—and dirt—through your door. Luckily, the kids will go back to school soon and the dust of summer fun will settle... but where does it all go? Unfortunately, most of it sinks right into your home’s ventilation system! Before you take a deep breath, and close up your home in anticipation for fall’s chilly descent, ensure the air you’re taking in is clean with a proper air duct cleaning.

## What exactly is an Air Duct Cleaning?

It’s cleaning your home’s entire ventilation system including the HVAC unit, blower, evaporator coil and accessible components, as well as the individual air ducts, from the vent covers to the main trunk line.

## Why is it important to clean my home’s ventilation system?

There are many reasons to perform regular ventilation system cleanings including health, efficiency, cost savings and safety.

* **Health** – The EPA estimates indoor air can be two to five times more polluted than outdoor air. According to the National Air Duct Cleaners Association, the average six-room home collects 40 pounds of dirt, dust and allergens in its air ducts each year. Those “dust bunnies” contain unhealthy bacteria, fungi, mold, and dust mites, which circulate through your house every time the heating or cooling system kicks on.
* **Cost** – Build-up of dirt and dust prevents air from flowing freely throughout the ventilation system. That means the system has to work harder, expending more energy and money to operate. As the dirt and dust builds up over time, it causes more ware and tear on your system, leading to a replacement sooner than you’d expect.
* **Safety** – As part of your ventilation system, dryer vents should be cleaned as well. Dryer vent cleaning not only saves you money in machine efficiency, it also can help prevent a dangerous dryer fire in your home.
