title: Area Rug Refresh
---

Other than paint, your floor coverings make the biggest impact on your home decor. While most people understand the benefits of regular carpet cleaning, area rugs can be tricky. It's tempting to just give them a quick going over when vacuuming or a lackluster shake off the back deck. While that's fine on a weekly basis, it doesn't really get them truly clean. When it comes to these rugs, it's smart to invest in professional rug cleaning. Why? Area rugs require a gentle but effective approach to cleaning from a professional rug cleaner with trained technicians who know how to handle the delicate fibers and backing materials found in various rugs.

Do-it-yourselfers often damage their rugs either because they scrub too hard or because they use the wrong cleaning solutions and equipment. Your area rugs are much too special—and often too expensive—to risk their safety or shorten their life.

At Stanley Steemer, we know that every area rug is different and that different rugs require different approaches. That's why we first conduct a thorough analysis of your area rugs, noting any heavily soiled or high-traffic areas that may need special attention. We determine which cleaning solution is best for your particular rugs, and then combine it with our state-of-the-art equipment for impressive results. We use the same hot-water extraction method on area rugs that we use on all carpets. It's gentle, but highly effective, and it will renew the beauty of your rugs.

From exotic heirlooms to everyday mud-blockers, the professional rug cleaners at Stanley Steemer know what's right for all your area rugs. And best of all, we'll take on the task while you relax. You can say goodbye to spots, spills and ground-in dirt and hello to area rugs that look brand new.
