title: Flooding in your home? Spring into Action!
---

We all look forward to the long awaited arrival of spring. But before the flowers can pop up and the grass can grow green, Mother Nature must do away with the enormous mounds of snow. Melting snow, combined with seasonal increases of rain, can be a lot for your yard to absorb. If water somehow makes its way within the walls of your home, it’s important to know that time is of the essence. Educate and prepare yourself <u>before</u> an emergency occurs. Check out these quick tips for taking your home from under water to under control…

1. **Safety First!** If you can safely access electrical devices, turn them off and remove them from areas with excess water. Wash your hands after handling damaged items. Avoid the possibility of electric shock—do not use a vacuum or shop vac to extract water.

2.	**Minimize Damage.** If possible, stop or slow the water at its source. Avoid walking on wet carpet and remove all furniture and items from carpet (especially breakable, moisture-sensitive and high value items). Put aluminum foil under the legs of any furniture that cannot be immediately moved to reduce rusting and staining. Pin up draperies and furniture skirts to avoid contact with water. Check under furniture, especially beds, for pooling water.

3.	**Water Extraction.** Water damage can pose threats to your home, personal belongings and safety. It’s best to hire a professional to extract the water from your home. Stanley Steemer’s trained technicians with exclusive state-of-the-art equipment are on call 24/7. Our equipment physically removes any freestanding water from carpet, padding and upholstery. If necessary, carpet and/or padding may be removed for proper drying. Our technicians use special instruments to identify hidden pockets of water and professional grade drying and dehumidifying equipment. Proper extraction and drying techniques help minimize the possibility of secondary damage, potential microbial growth and reduces costs. We’ll also monitor the drying process daily, repositioning drying equipment as needed.

***Experts you can trust.***
All Stanley Steemer water restoration specialists have Institute of Inspection Cleaning and Restoration Certification (IICRC), the most widely recognized and accepted certification program in the industry. Our technicians also regularly attend IICRC-accredited continuing education and training programs. We provide the time and money to train our people, and we supply them with the best equipment available.
